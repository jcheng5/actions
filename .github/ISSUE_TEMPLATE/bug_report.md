**STOP**

If you are debugging a failed build or have a question about GitHub Actions in
general do **NOT** open an issue here. Either post on the Actions sections of
the [GitHub Community](https://github.community/c/code-to-cloud/github-actions/41) or the [Posit Community](https://forum.posit.co/new-topic?category=Package%20development&tags=github-actions) forums.

Open an issue here _only_ if you have a bug in one of the
custom R specific actions themselves.

**Describe the bug**
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**To Reproduce**
You **MUST** include a link to the full logs of the failed build. Bug reports which do not contain a link, or only contain a screenshot of the failed build will be closed.

**Expected behavior**
A clear and concise description of what you expected to happen.

**Additional context**
Add any other context about the problem here.
